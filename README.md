We rely heavily on JavaScript's asynchronous nature to get things done; however, async code puts a mental burden on the developer and can lead to the dreaded "callback hell". In this talk I will explore the new async/await feature introduced in ES2017. async/await is THE solution to async control flow, making our code easier to understand and simpler to write. async/await will change your life.
